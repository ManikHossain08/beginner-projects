# Beginner Projects

A couple of beginner projects here, listed from easiest to hardest :)

- `selector.py`: simply a random selector to tell me who to facetime! (deals with imports)
- `login.py`: a fake login that lets you look like you're hacking into some super secret mainframe lol (practice with if statements, imports, print statements)
- `madlibs.py`: madlibs! (practice with inputs, strings)
- `rock_paper_scissors.py`: rock paper scissors (practice with functions and if statements)
- NOTE: `random_madlibs.py` and `sample_madlibs` are madlibs that I created if you just want to play around with them
- `web_app`: build your own web app using flask! (this would be more intermediate, but give it a try if you're feeling ambitious!!)
